# Particle
The purpose of this project is to use Particle to toggle a counter on a seven segment display on a Raspberry Pi from a remote device using the Particle app.

Create a particle account [here](https://login.particle.io/signup).

Download and open the app on a smartphone [here](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/tinker/raspberry-pi).

Then go [here](build.particle.io) to open the web IDE and insert the counter code there.

Verify then flash the code to your raspberry pi to run the project.

Other resources I used for functions are [here](https://docs.particle.io/reference/device-os/firmware/raspberry-pi/), and [here](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/discontinued/raspberrypi-datasheet/) for more about how Particle interfaces with Raspberry Pi.
