# Particle
The purpose of this project is to use Particle to toggle a counter on a seven segment display on a Raspberry Pi from a remote device using the Particle app.
Create a particle account [here](https://login.particle.io/signup).
Download and open the app on a smartphone here [https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/tinker/raspberry-pi].
Then go [here](build.particle.io) to open the web IDE and insert the counter code there.
Verify then flash the code to your raspberry pi to run the project.
